=head1 NAME

Minion::Backend::Redis - Redis backend for Minion job queue

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Minion::Backend::Redis;
  my $backend = Minion::Backend::Redis->new('redis://127.0.0.1:6379/5');

  # Minion
  use Minion;
  my $minion = Minion->new(Redis => 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379');

  # Mojolicious (via Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion)
  $self->plugin(Minion => { Redis => 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/2' });

  # Mojolicious::Lite (via Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion)
  plugin Minion => { Redis => 'redis://x:s3cret@127.0.0.1:6379' };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Backend::Redis> is a backend for L<Minion> based on L<Mojo::Redis>.
Note that L<Redis Server|https://redis.io/download> version C<2.8.0> or newer
is required to use this backend.

=head1 CAUTION

This is a slightly hackish modification of the original code by L<Dan Book|https://github.com/Grinnz/Minion-Backend-Redis> to use L<Mojo::Redis> instead of L<Mojo::Redis2>.

Due to the original code being written against an older Minion version, "history" is currently unimplemented.
